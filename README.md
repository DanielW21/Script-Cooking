# 🍳 Script-Cooking

Script-Cooking is a smart, AI-powered cooking assistant that helps you go from recipe discovery to hands-free cooking execution and support finding recipes and planning your next meal. 

## 🔥 Features

### 🥕 Pre-Cooking

1. **Smart Ingredient Generator**  
   Automatically generate a list of ingredients from recipes based on input interest found on websites or YouTube, so you know exactly what to buy before starting.

2. **Recipe Aggregator & Comparator**  
   Find recipes tailored to your interests across YouTube and cooking sites. Cross-compare them to identify the best match based on ingredients, cooking time, dietary restrictions, etc.

3. **Recipe Modifier**

### 🍳 Cooking Mode

1. **Recipe Scraper (YouTube + Web)**  
   Extract step-by-step cooking instructions from YouTube videos or online recipes and turn them into an actionable checklist.

2. **Voice-Driven Cooking**  
   Go fully hands-free: Use voice commands to progress to the next step, repeat a step, or jump back in the recipe — perfect for when your hands are covered in flour!
